              In this video I talked about Intramuros and shared my thoughts why
              I think it is important and worthwhile to restore it to its former
              glory.
            </p>

            <p>
              Intramuros, or the ‘Walled City’, is one of the oldest districts
              of Manila, built on the south bank of the Pasig River around 1571.
              It was built by the Spaniards – more specifically by Miguel Lopez
              de Legaspi – and is bound on all sides by moats and thick, high
              walls, with some over 6 metres high.
            </p>

            <p>
              During World War II, Intramuros was used as a garrison and prison
              facility by the Japanese, but Allied bombings resulted in it, and
              other parts of Manila, being severely damaged and destroyed. At
              the end of the war, the US took charge of the city and filled in
              the moat to prevent disease. A golf course has now been built in
              the place where the moat once existed.
            </p>

            <p>
              Restoring Intramuros is an act of preserving history. Intramuros
              is a living museum, and its restoration would help us relive the
              past, appreciate our roots, and educate future generations about
              our rich heritage.
