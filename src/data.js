            walls, with some over 6 metres high.`,

            the end of the war, the US took charge of the city and filled in

Now, we have another topic to talk about and that is about the battle of Manila in 1945. So there were three main forces during that battle–Filipinos and Americans, and the Japanese. Mr. Villegas, our professor in Readings in the Philippine History–the one that gave this task to us–shared with us a video documentary on the battle of Manila in 1945. `,

The Japanese soldiers did not like going to war and enjoyed killing people. He said that it was not their choice and that they were only ordered.

That way, we can increase the sense of pride of the citizens of our own country. At the same time we should participate in any social activities as volunteering, donating to charity, or joining community events can increase the sense of unity of our people. Thus being a people of harmony and unity, we could show that we are one and that we love our country as our own and with pride.`,
